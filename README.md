> * Project Title: Opinion Formation

## General Introduction


We found out that existing simulations about opinion formation don´t cover the fact that agents do not meet randomly and that the agents stubbornness and convicibility are not taken account of.
This way we (hope to) get more realistic simulations and more detailed analysis of opinion convergence.
Opinion Formation is a phenomenon that can be observed in many aspects of human life.

## The Model

We concentrate on improving an existing model by taking account of the following:
> * How can we express different opinions? Can we measure the "distance" between opinions?
> * How can we implement the effect of stubbornness and convincibility?
> * How should these factors be weighted? (Can we use physics?)
(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.)
(Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?)
(Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

How do our additional assumptions about opinion formation influence the results of previous simulations?
To what extent does the convincibility factor influence the outcome of the simulation, or can it be ignored?
People tend to meet their "friends" (wich have a similar opinion) more often or tend to abvoid people they don´t like (because of their opinion?), such that it is not to expect that an agents opinion changes significantly.

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

We expect that the formation of clusters will change because, as in reality, convincibility and stubbornness influence the convergence of opinion formations.
(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

## Research Methods

Agent-Based Model, maybe we can use Cellular Automata for this purpose.
(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)
